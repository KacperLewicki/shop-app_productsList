The challenge consists of creating a simple product listing web application that fetches and displays product information from a JSON API.

Task Duration: Up to 3 hours

Technologies and Skills Tested:

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

- Task Description:

You are required to create a basic web application that displays a list of products fetched from a JSON API. The application should have a responsive design and should be built using React components.

## Task Steps:

1. Clone the starter repository from the provided Git repository URL.

2. Prepare API based on Free API Editor mocki.io from project source file /api/products.json

3. Set up a new React application within the cloned repository.

4. Create a component to fetch data from self prepared JSON API.

5. Display the fetched product data in a visually appealing manner. Each product should be displayed as a card containing the following information:

- Product Name
- Description
- Manufacturer
- Availability (In Stock/Out of Stock) - if attribute "is_salable" = 0 don't display product.
- Price - net / gross (calculated based on tax and api net price) - with special display information and price calculation for promotion if applicable (promotional discount applies to the net price)

6. Implement a basic filtering mechanism that allows users to filter products based on their availability (In Stock/Out of Stock).

7. Apply basic styling using CSS to enhance the visual appeal of the application.

8. Ensure the application is responsive and provides a seamless user experience on both desktop and mobile devices.

9. Initialize a Git repository for version control and commit your changes regularly.

10. Push your completed solution to your GitHub repository and share the repository URL with us.
